# New Project Form Updates

## Changes Made

Updated the New Project form to remove manual fields that are now automatically determined and enhanced the Class 1 building analysis.

### üóëÔ∏è **Removed Fields:**

1. **NCC Version Field**

   - **Location**: Project Information section
   - **Reason**: NCC version is now automatically determined by the system
   - **Impact**: Removes manual selection burden from users
   - **Auto-detection**: System automatically uses the latest NCC version

2. **Zoning Field**
   - **Location**: Site Address & Property Details section
   - **Reason**: Zoning is now automatically detected from address search
   - **Impact**: Eliminates manual data entry and reduces errors
   - **Auto-detection**: Populated automatically when address is selected using state mapping data

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced Features:**
